# ADME
Predicting ADME Properties of Molecules Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

# Overview
This project aims to predict ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties of small molecules using Graph Neural Networks. Initially, the focus is on a single ADME property: solubility, using the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) dataset.
