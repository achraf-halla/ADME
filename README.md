# ADME
Predicting ADME Properties of Molecules Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

# Overview
This project aims to predict ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties of small molecules using Graph Neural Networks, using the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) dataset. I will keep a log here detailing the stuff I tried


#Ideas:

Try different Featurization methods ?
